        <h2>El Dia que Trascendi los Limited del la Cordura</h2>
        <p>The story is about Ana, an adopted woman who suffers from bipolar disorder and is a victim of her circumstances. Despite all the love her adoptive family provided, the system and her environment prevented her from breaking free from the darkness that engulfed her. The plot is easy to understand and allows the reader to get involved from the very first sentence. It is rich in details and imagery. The characters are well-crafted, and each has their moment in the story. The author alludes to historical moments that allow the reader to connect in time and space. I mention these details because, as a reader, they are what caught my attention the most, to the point that I could identify with the story in many moments. We have all felt like Ana at some point or have shared experiences with someone like her, but the question is: are we doing things right? So, this story is perfect for caregivers. When I mention the word "caregiver," I refer to someone who has the task or responsibility of accompanying a family member or dear friend going through experiences similar to Ana's. The book excellently addresses topics such as prejudice, infidelity, love, self-love, feminism, identity, and, of course, mental health. I emphasize that they are treated with great responsibility. </p>
