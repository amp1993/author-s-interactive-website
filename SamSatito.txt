Story:  Sam Satito

    Hi, my name is Sam Satito. I’m a mix of different  doggies. I was born in a shelter for abandoned  animals. Every day I beg for someone to adopt me. A  man shows up at the shelter, picks me up, and takes  me to his car.
    Looking out the window , I can see we arrive at a  very big house. A lady comes over and ties a blue  ribbon around my neck. Uff! How it itches! The  house is full of colorful ballons and lots of kids!  A girl with a red ribbon on her head comes to me  with open arms and fills me with cuddles. I finally  have a family!
    The floor of the house is very soft, just like bgrass.  I went tinkle there as they taught me at the shelter,  but my new family got mad at me. Why? I didn’t do  anything wrong, did I?
    The girl has many pretty toys. I really like her  dolls. If I hop on the bed and pull them by the hair,  I will be able to play with them. Oh, no¡ I ripped  them¡ The girl just got here and is yelling. I get  scare and hide. Now the girl is crying. I try to lick  her hand, but she pushes me away. I don?t want  her to cry¡ I am very sad. She doesn’t want to play  with me anymore.
    The man puts the leash on me and takes me in his  car to a place I have never been to before. He opens  the door. We are going for a walk¡ I think and hop out.  It seems that something scared him because he runs  to the car, gets in, and leaves.
    I think a few days have passed because the moon has  come up many times. I’m so hungry¡ I’m going to walk  around and look for food. It’s dark again. I don’t know  how to get back¡ How will I get them to find me?
    I have been alone for a long time. I don’t eat well and,  sometimes, I don’t drink any wáter all day. People  push me away and some even hit me. I’m scared of  them and hide under a bench.
    A liitle old lady comes by in the afternoons and  brings food, but the big dogs eat it all. They are  hungry too. I know this because I see them going  through the trash. Poor guys, I see how badly people  treat them, just like they do to me.
    No one pets me because I’m dirty and I smell bad. I  try to play with the children , but their mothers don’t  let them. They hit me with their umbrellas.
    Today I got very scared when one of the moms threw  a rock at me. I ran away and, before I knew it, I ran  into the street. A car hit me and didn’t stop to check.  Now I’m limping.
    A little old lady picks me up. She wraps me in her  coat, not caring if I get it dirty. She leaves me with a  man in a white coat. He heals me.
    Now I live in a shelter for animals abandoned by  humans. There are different types of animals: dogs,  cats, pigs, horses; all different sizes and colors.
    They take really good care of me at the shelter. They  give me food and wáter and take me for a walk twice  a day. Oh, but how I wish I had a human to play with¡
    A year has passed, and all my friends have gone  to new homes. Today is Visiting Day. A girl with  lots of drawings on her skin and very short pink  
    hair comes in. She walks in front of my cage and  looks at me. 
    I get close to the cage bars and wag my tail. I look  at her lovingly. I hope she picks me ¡ My caretaker  opens the cage and puts a leash on me. She hugs  
    me with lots of love and pets me. She likes me ¡ I’m  going home with her¡
    Three years have passed since Margie adopted me.  She lets me sleep on her bed. A tall guy with a long  hair (she calls him José) visits her often. Today he  
    put something on her left finger. She hugged him  happily. I’m afraid that she will leave with him and  won’t love me anymore¡
    Margie is dressed in white. I have a small pillow on my  
    back with something shiny on it. I also have a collar with  
    a very handsome bow tie. I am walking in front of Margie¿  José calls me over and I sit next to him. He leans over and  hugs me. I love him very much. 
    Margie looks beautiful. They take the  
    shiny things from the pillow and put them  
    on each other’s fingers. They look so  
    happy! José pats me on the back and calls  
    me over to walk with them. I feel so lucky! 
    Margie has something in her belly. She lets me lie on  her belly and sometimes I can fell little taps. Today  Margie was complaining a lot. José came running and  took her away. I wonder what happened. I’m so worried!
    After three days, Margie comes back home. She  is holding a little bundle in her arms that moves  and smells really nice. She sits beside me and  shows it to me. She says that this is my brother  and Ineed to take care of him. I feel very happy!
    Joselito is now five years old. He always wants to be  with me¡ I take good care of him and don’t let strngers  go near him. Margie has a big belly again and something  is moving inside again too. I wll have a sister now and  her name will be Sofía. What I will do now? I sleep with  Joselito, so now I will have to sleep with him one day  and with Sofía the next
    Many years have passed . Joselito has a beard now  and is very tal. He is studying far away. Every time he  comes over, he brings the treats I love the most, but I  can barely chew them anymore.
    I’m so tired now. Sofía carries me everywhere. On  Sundays, she puts me on a wagon and takes me to the  beach. She then puts me on a float and gives me a ride.
    Margie and José’s hair is gray now and they look  just as tired as Iam. Still, they cuddle me like the  first day, I’m ready to leave behind this little body  that serves as a safe to keep my wings. I want to  stretch them out so I can cross the rainbow.
    I had a good life; I was loved, and  
    I was taken care of. I was always part of the  
    family. Now I need to rest. Sofía has Missy, a little  sick cat she rescued from the street. I know Missy will make  them happy and they will make the Kitty happy too. My  wings spread open. With time they will understand that all  doggies are angels that come down to complete a mission.  Now I leave happily to cross the rainbow, towards animal  heaven.
